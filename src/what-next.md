# What's next?

Congratulations, you have finished this mini-book! I hope you have learned something. This is my first mini-book. To be honest, it is not easy for me to finish it because Airflow (and Composer) is such an extensive ecosystem. I tried my best to include important and practical knowledge that I learned when I worked as a Data Engineer in the past few years using Airflow.

If you are interested in learning more about Airflow and Composer, below are some resources:

- Airflow official documentation: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/
- Airflow opensource project: https://github.com/apache/airflow
- Airflow guides from Astronomer: https://www.astronomer.io/guides/
- Google Cloud Composer documentation: https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs
- Google Cloud Skills Boost(search Composer): https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog

Finally, create some awesome (and shitty) data pipelines!

Bye for now!
