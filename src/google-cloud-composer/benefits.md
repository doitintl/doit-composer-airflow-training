# Benefits

As a fully managed Airflow service, Cloud Composer has the below benefits:

- Fully managed workflow orchestration
  - Cloud Composer's managed nature and Apache Airflow compatibility allow you to focus on authoring, scheduling and monitoring your workflows as opposed to provisioning resources.
- Integrates with other Google Cloud products
  - End-to-end integration with Google Cloud products, including BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Datastore, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, and AI Platform, gives users the freedom to fully orchestrate their pipeline.
- Supports hybrid and multi-cloud
  - Author, schedule, and monitor your workflows through a single orchestration toolâ€”whether your pipeline lives on-premises, in multiple clouds, or fully within Google Cloud.
