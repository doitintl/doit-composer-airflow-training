# Introduction

**Working in progress**

This repository aims to provide a short course about the basics of [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and how it runs on [Google Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer) on Google Cloud, as well as common Cloud Composer issues and their solutions.

The repository uses [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) to create a mini book tutorial website. It also contains the source code of the tutorial.

## Learning Goals
