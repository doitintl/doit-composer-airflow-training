# Introduction

**Working in progress**

This repository aims to provide a short course about the basics of [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and how it runs on [Google Cloud Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer) on Google Cloud, as well as common Cloud Composer issues and their solutions.

The repository uses [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) to create a mini-book tutorial. The source code of it can be found under the code folder.

## Learning Goals

Through this course, you will get experience working with Airflow data pipelines workloads on Google Cloud Composer. You will become familiar with the following topics:

* Apache Airflow and its concepts
* Understanding of Google Cloud Composer
* Setting up Airflow
* Building Airflow pipelines
* Common Composer tickets

## Access the mini-book

This mini-book is hosted on GitHub pages, you can access it from [here](https://doitintl.github.io/doit-composer-airflow-training/index.html)
